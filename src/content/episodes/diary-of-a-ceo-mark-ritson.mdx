Ritson argues that "unique selling points" are mostly a myth. Consumers don't remember small differences between products. They remember brands that are **distinctive** — those with recognizable assets that cut through the noise. He cites the "Big Red" study to prove that saliency beats nuance every single time.

A deep dive into Binet and Field's landmark research. Mark explains why companies that over-invest in performance marketing (bottom of funnel) experience a "performance plateau" that eventually leads to brand erosion and decreased price elasticity. The data is damning: brands that shift budget from brand to performance see short-term gains followed by a cliff.

Strategy is defined by what you choose NOT to do. Ritson critiques modern CMOs for trying to be "everything to everyone" instead of picking three core strategic objectives and ignoring the rest of the noise.
