  - label: "What changed your thinking"
    text: "Distinctiveness, not differentiation, is the only sustainable competitive advantage in brand building."
  - label: "What most people get wrong"
    text: "The 60/40 brand-vs-performance split isn't a rule. Over-indexing on performance creates a plateau trap that erodes pricing power."
  - label: "Apply in B2B / GTM"
    text: "Strategy means sacrifice. Pick three objectives, say no to everything else. Most CMOs fail by trying to do everything."
  - label: "Where we disagree"
    text: "Ritson's dismissal of digital attribution is too sweeping. Multi-touch still has a role in long B2B cycles."
keyQuotes:
  - timestamp: "15:02"
    quote: "The biggest mistake in marketing today is that we have too many digital tacticians posing as brand strategists. They know how to buy an ad, but they don't know why they're buying it."
  - timestamp: "32:44"
    quote: "Market research isn't about asking people what they want. They don't know. It's about observing the friction in their lives and realizing your brand is the only thing that removes it smoothly."
  - timestamp: "51:18"
    quote: "Brand is the long game. If you're not prepared to lose money for the first three years of brand building, you're not building a brand. You're just doing expensive performance marketing."
