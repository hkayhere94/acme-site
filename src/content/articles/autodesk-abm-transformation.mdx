takeaways:
  - label: "Core Thesis"
    text: "Autodesk's subscription pivot required a fundamental shift from product-push to account-centric engagement. ABM became the operating system for that shift."
  - label: "Key Insight"
    text: "Naming it 'ABSM' (Account-Based Sales and Marketing) was a deliberate move. Joint KPIs with sales and 1:1 'account therapy' sessions made alignment real, not aspirational."
  - label: "Practitioner Takeaway"
    text: "Personalized microsites via Folloze scaled ABM to 10,000 global accounts within a year. Digital + physical direct mail made it memorable."
  - label: "Contrarian View"
    text: "Revenue grew from $2.1B to $5.3B (FY18-FY24), but isolating ABM's contribution from the broader subscription shift remains impossible to prove."
